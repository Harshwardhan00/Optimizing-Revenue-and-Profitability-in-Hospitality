Project Overview: Optimizing Revenue Leakage & Profitability in the Hospitality Sector
Team Members: Harshwardhan
Project Theme: Revenue Optimization in the Hotel Industry

Objective:
To analyze performance data of hotel properties and identify ways to reduce revenue leakage while improving profitability and guest satisfaction.

Key Segments Analyzed:
1. Business Category Hotels

i. Struggling Hotels (Low revenue, low ratings): Require urgent intervention such as service quality improvement, better check-in experience, or even shutting down underperforming properties.

ii. Under-Monetized Hotels (High ratings, low revenue): These hotels have good guest satisfaction but fail to monetize effectively.

Recommendations:

a. Introduce value-added services (e.g., business amenities, room packages).

b. Convert underutilized spaces into co-working areas or rentable meeting rooms.

c. Promote direct bookings to reduce commission costs and improve margins.

iii. At-Risk Hotels (High revenue, low ratings): Risk of long-term revenue decline due to low guest retention and negative reviews.

Recommendations:

a. Improve customer experience while upselling services.

b. Use unused spaces for business-focused amenities without changing base pricing.

2. Luxury Category Hotels

i. Under-Monetized Properties (High ratings, low revenue): Indicates missed opportunities to capitalize on guest satisfaction.

Recommendations:

a. Offer premium packages such as wellness retreats, fine dining, or guided tours.

b. Monetize lounges/spas through non-guest access or memberships.

c. Form partnerships with luxury brands to enhance perceived value.

ii. At-Risk Properties (High revenue, low ratings): Guest dissatisfaction can damage reputation in the premium market.

Recommendations:

a.Focus on personalized guest experiences.

b.Train staff, implement real-time feedback, and ensure consistent service across departments.

Specific Case Recommendations:
i. Atliq Seasons, Mumbai: Premium pricing with limited capacity and low ratings.

Recommendation: Expand room capacity or repurpose space to better serve demand and optimize fixed costs.

ii. Elie Rooms & RT2 Rooms: High booking frequency but low revenue per room.

Recommendation: Use dynamic pricing, offer tiered room types, and bundle amenities like breakfast or workspace access to increase profitability.

Outcome:
This project delivers a comprehensive strategy for hotel chains to:

i. Identify performance bottlenecks,

ii. Reduce revenue leakage,

iii. Enhance customer satisfaction, and

iv. Maximize property-wise profitability through tailored, actionable recommendations.
